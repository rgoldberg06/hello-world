# hello-world
first time practicing with any coding. :)

I am such a beginner. My husband and I just moved to Seattle from Portland, and I have found myself doing the same thing here that I did for 10+ years there (CSR at a vet clinic) and I need a change so badly! I started getting interested in coding, but short of making a few god awful websites as a kid using an HTML book, my experience with tech stuff is pretty much limited to what I had to know about operating a computer to get through college and life as a working adult. Coding is something so new to me that it is daunting and I don't really know where to start.
